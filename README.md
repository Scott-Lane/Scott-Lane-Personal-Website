Personal-Website
This project is my introduction to web development. This project will include three html pages 'about' 'portfolio' and a 'home' page. The project will also include CSS and Javascript adding color, life and features to my personal website. This project will be created by myself with input from my professor. I will be the sole contributor for this project.
