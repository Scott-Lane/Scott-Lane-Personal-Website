                    <p> " Reading comic books has been one of my most enjoyable hobbies. It allows me to take a step back from consistent responsibilites and step into another world.
                        The stories created as well as impressive art styles never dissappoint. It is a medium of storytelling that conveys amazing character depth and action similar to 
                        how any movie or tv show can. "

                    <p>
                        " Not only do I enjoy comics for reading pleasure but there is a certain satisfaction in collecting comics, because for me, finding an old key issue or famous run 
                        of comics is the same as preserving history. I believe for the medium it is important to preserve and collect so that the joy can be shared with family, 
                        friends and future generations. "

                        learn and accomplish. The medium I currently work in is pencil and ink but hope to learn more about digital art and color theory."

                    " Playing multiple sports through out my life I enjoy staying active for physcial and mental health. I have a bachelors degree in Sports and Exercise Science. Although 
                    I am making the career switch to web development, exercise will always play an important role in my life. I have not had the time to play organized sports since becoming a father
                    but, I have continued with a weight lifting program that includes some cardio activites such as running, hiking and working with a punching bag. The benefits I gain from an active
                    lifestyle are immense in my daily life, and most importantly it allows me to keep up with my little one."
